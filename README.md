# Morpheus Colorectal Cancer DNA Methylation Browser

This repo provides guidelines on how to visualize and analyze massive Colorectal Cancer DNA Methylation and Clinical datasets from [TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) using javascript powered heatmaps ([Morpheus.js](https://github.com/cmap/morpheus.js)) in the browser.

We will utilize [flask] as our webserver to run a local instance of ([Morpheus.js](https://github.com/cmap/morpheus.js)).
